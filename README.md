# These Python codes were part of assignments and challenges as I learned Python programming.
# I scored well overall but in no way are these the only way to solve the questions. I may have lost marks as well for overlooking certain things. 
# Let me know if you see a better way of solving them in a way that could reduce computational complexity etc
